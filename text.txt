**Manager Dashboard: Streamline Team Management**

On the Manager Dashboard, you take control of your team's productivity with the Employee Management Application. Here's how it works:

1. **Employee Directory:** The Employee Directory is your comprehensive database of all team members. Each employee's profile includes vital information such as contact details, job roles, skills, and work history. Easily find the right person for the task you have in mind.

2. **Task Assignment:** Assigning tasks to employees has never been easier. Select the team member you want to assign a task to and provide details such as task description, deadline, and priority level. You can even attach relevant documents or resources.

3. **Task Tracking:** Keep track of the progress of assigned tasks. You'll receive real-time updates on the status of each task, ensuring you're always informed about your team's productivity.

4. **Leave Approvals:** The Manager Dashboard also handles leave requests from your employees. Approve or deny leave requests directly from the dashboard, all while maintaining a clear overview of your team's availability.

5. **Analytics:** Visualize your team's productivity and performance using charts and graphs. Data-driven insights help you make informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and optimize team performance.

With the Manager Dashboard, you can effortlessly manage your team, allocate tasks, and maintain a high level of organization within your workforce. Whether it's keeping track of employee assignments or ensuring smooth leave management, this tool simplifies the process, leaving you more time to focus on what matters most â€“ achieving your team's goals.
